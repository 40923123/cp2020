<h1>HW1</h1>
<h2>unit 1 succeeding PC Hardware</h2>
<p id="N10654" lang="">PC Hardware is an online course, where the content will be presented in the form of both text and activities.</p>
<p id="N10657" lang="">While you will have more flexibility than in a traditional course, you will also have more responsibility for your own learning. You will need to:</p>
<ul lang="">
<li lang="">Plan how to work through each unit.</li>
<li lang="">Determine how to use the various features of the course to help you learn.</li>
<li lang="">Decide when you need to seek additional support.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="N10666">
<div class="sectionContain">
<h3 contenteditable="true" lang=""><span title="Quick scroll up">What You Need to Know About the Course</span></h3>
<p id="N1066D" lang="">This course contains multiple modules. Each module has features designed to support you as an independent learner, including:</p>
<ul lang="">
<li lang=""><em class="bold" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Learning Objectives:</em></em><span> </span>These are descriptions of what you should be able to do at the end of a section. A Learning Objective will allow you to direct your learning efforts and enable you to monitor your progress as you explore the content and engage in the activities.</li>
<li lang=""><em class="bold" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Explanatory Content:</em></em><span> </span>This is the informational “meat” of every chapter. Consisting of short passages of text with information, examples, images, and explanations, this explanatory content contains pieces such as:
<ul lang="">
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Walk-throughs:</em><span> </span>These are videos embedded in the pages to exemplify the concepts you are exploring. They may provide a more detailed explanation of a topic or guide you through the steps of a process.</li>
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Examples:</em><span> </span>Designed to illustrate specific applications of the skills and learning objectives that the course supports you to achieve.</li>
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Labs:</em><span> </span>Simulations and lab activities designed to give you an opportunity to interact with various hardware elements.</li>
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Many Students Wonder sidebars:</em><span> </span>These sidebars serve two purposes: (1) to give a quick review of concepts, such as "highly specialized input devices," that are used in the PC Hardware material and (2) to provide additional material or background information that you may find surprising and interesting but that is not going to be assessed in the Quiz.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li lang=""><em class="bold" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Learning Activities:</em></em><span> </span>There are different types of activities interspersed throughout the course. They include:
<ul lang="">
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Learn By Doing activities:</em><span> </span>Learn By Doing activities follow the short explanations and examples. These activities give you the chance to investigate and practice key ideas. Learn By Doing activities have hints and feedback to guide you if you need it.</li>
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Did I Get This? activities:</em><span> </span>Did I Get This? activities are your chance to do a quick "self-check." These activities do not have hints, and often follow a Learn by Doing activity so that you can determine if you understand the key ideas. This will help you make sure you are ready for graded activities.</li>
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Quizzes:</em><span> </span>These are short assignments that are graded. There is a Quiz at the end of each Module. The Quiz will show you and your instructor how well you understand the key concepts. If you read the information and do the activities in each Module, you should be ready for the Quiz.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li lang=""><em class="bold" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Metacognitive Activities:</em></em><span> </span>These activities are designed to support your development as an independent learner, encouraging you to reflect on your progress and plan for continuing success. These activities include:
<ul lang="">
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">My Response activities:</em><span> </span>These short activities are located at the end of the module; they encourage you to reflect on your progress through the module and estimate how well you believe you've attained the module's learning objectives. These activities also provide a place to share continuing questions and areas of difficulty (if you're using the course in conjunction with an instructor, your questions will be shared with your instructor).</li>
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Checkpoints:</em><span> </span>These activities are located across the course after sections of content that can be particularly challenging or require additional practice. These metacognitive<span> </span><span class="term" lang="">checkpoints</span>encourage you to review your progress so far and assess yourself: are you ready to continue, or do you believe you need additional materials, practice, or self-assessment? If you feel that you're not ready to proceed, these checkpoints provide links to additional learning materials.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Kaggle</h1>
<h2>cp2020</h2>
<h1>問題排除</h1>
<h2>1 heading問題</h2>
<p>已知heading無法使用標點符號作為標題</p>
<h2>2 提醒</h2>
<p>根據嘗試遠端更新資料速度貌似要過好幾分鐘才會更新</p>
<h2>3 user內容的方式</h2>
<p>.gitconfig若要新增username跟usergmail還是以指令輸入較好，貌似就算格式符合手動輸入依然跟指令輸入有些不同(PS即便我自己是手動添加但其他同學卻出現讀不出來的情況)，會出現無法使用的name和gmail並叫我以指令添加，目前無法得知手動輸入和指令輸入的差別或自行輸入錯誤，但用指令輸入並無其他問題算是排除</p>
<h2>4 github page not updating</h2>
<p>再上傳3.問題時由於我將內文設定成heading並且此內容裡正好包含標點符號，所以合理猜測由於跟1.問題符合導致東西在PUSH上去時可能無法讀取或錯誤進而導致靜態網頁內容更改但遠端網站的setting無法成功(若要成功必須有<span>GitHub Pages successfully built your site.跟</span>GitHub Pages successfully built your site.就是綠勾勾的出現)，所以即便倉儲的東西及標籤都是最新的但網站setting並不符合或承認此內容資料，將內文的heading的設定消除掉後重新PUSH上去就沒問題，起初以為是設定有動到所以上網找資料查詢但發現都是updataing網站更新數據問題，但我並未出現404錯誤所以我就往是否為我PUSH上去的內容有不符合或錯誤來實驗並最後得出此答案，問題解除</p>
<h2>5 網站編輯器無法開啟</h2>
<p>因為不明原因，導致編輯器無法啟動變成只打開原始代碼，先將目錄換到cmsimde用git pull將最新版代替舊版，將新的cmsimde代替原本的來解決</p>
<h2>6</h2>
<div class="d-flex col-2 flex-shrink-0"></div>

<h1>教學歷程</h1>
<h2>W1至W8</h2>
<p>1.網路的一些性質及介紹等(proxy,ipv6,ipv4等) 2.利用kaggle進行網路上的程式編寫練習 3.Github,gitter,Heroku,等之間的使用方法及目的: 基本來說利用USB或者電腦本身進行寫程式(近端)，不只讓他保存並將其推到網路上(遠端)以實現多重保障並也能讓其他人觀看自己的作品，方便之後若有需要時不會發生資料遺漏或者資料不小心遺失也能搶救。</p>
