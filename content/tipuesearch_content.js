Each module has features designed to support you as an independent learner, including: \n \n Learning Objectives: \xa0 These are descriptions of what you should be able to do at the end of a section. A Learning Objective will allow you to direct your learning efforts and enable you to monitor your progress as you explore the content and engage in the activities. \n Explanatory Content: \xa0 This is the informational “meat” of every chapter. Consisting of short passages of text with information, examples, images, and explanations, this explanatory content contains pieces such as:\n \n Walk-throughs: \xa0 These are videos embedded in the pages to exemplify the concepts you are exploring. They may provide a more detailed explanation of a topic or guide you through the steps of a process. \n Examples: \xa0 Designed to illustrate specific applications of the skills and learning objectives that the course supports you to achieve. \n Labs: \xa0 Simulations and lab activities designed to give you an opportunity to interact with various hardware elements. \n Many Students Wonder sidebars: \xa0 These sidebars serve two purposes: (1) to give a quick review of concepts, such as "highly specialized input devices," that are used in the PC Hardware material and (2) to provide additional material or background information that you may find surprising and interesting but that is not going to be assessed in the Quiz. \n \n \n Learning Activities: \xa0 There are different types of activities interspersed throughout the course. They include:\n \n Learn By Doing activities: \xa0 Learn By Doing activities follow the short explanations and examples. These activities give you the chance to investigate and practice key ideas. Learn By Doing activities have hints and feedback to guide you if you need it. \n Did I Get This? activities: \xa0 Did I Get This? activities are your chance to do a quick "self-check." These activities do not have hints, and often follow a Learn by Doing activity so that you can determine if you understand the key ideas. This will help you make sure you are ready for graded activities. \n Quizzes: \xa0 These are short assignments that are graded. There is a Quiz at the end of each Module. The Quiz will show you and your instructor how well you understand the key concepts. If you read the information and do the activities in each Module, you should be ready for the Quiz. \n \n \n Metacognitive Activities: \xa0 These activities are designed to support your development as an independent learner, encouraging you to reflect on your progress and plan for continuing success. These activities include:\n \n My Response activities: \xa0 These short activities are located at the end of the module; they encourage you to reflect on your progress through the module and estimate how well you believe you\'ve attained the module\'s learning objectives. These activities also provide a place to share continuing questions and areas of difficulty (if you\'re using the course in conjunction with an instructor, your questions will be shared with your instructor). \n Checkpoints: \xa0 These activities are located across the course after sections of content that can be particularly challenging or require additional practice. These metacognitive \xa0 checkpoints encourage you to review your progress so far and assess yourself: are you ready to continue, or do you believe you need additional materials, practice, or self-assessment? If you feel that you\'re not ready to proceed, these checkpoints provide links to additional learning materials. \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'What You Need to Know About the Course.html'}, {'title': 'About These Materials', 'text': '©2016 \xa0 Cyber Pathways Across Maryland . \n Unless otherwise specified, CPAM materials are licensed under a \xa0 Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License . \n This workforce solution was funded by a grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration.

It involves five distinct skills:\n \n Assessing the task. \n Evaluating your strengths and weaknesses. \n Planning an approach. \n Applying strategies and monitoring your performance. \n Reflecting and adjusting if needed. \n \n \n \n \n \n The diagram below shows you one example of the metacognitive cycle. Hover over the individual skills to learn more. \n \n \n EXAMPLE \n \n Metacognition in Action \n \n You get an assignment and ask yourself: \n “What exactly does this assignment involve and what have I learned in this course that is relevant to it?” \n You are exercising metacognitive skills #1 and #2 by assessing the task and evaluating your strengths and weaknesses in relation to it. If you think about what steps you need to take to complete the assignment and determine when it is reasonable to begin, you are exercising skill #3 by planning. If you start in on your plan and realize that you are working more slowly than you anticipated, you are putting skill #4 to work by applying a strategy and monitoring your performance. Finally, if you reflect on your performance in relation to your time frame for the task, and discover an equally effective but more efficient way to work, you are engaged in skill #5 of reflecting and adjusting your approach as needed. \n Metacognition is not rocket science. In some respects, it is fairly ordinary and intuitive. Yet you’d be surprised how often people lack strong metacognitive skills, and you’d be amazed by how much weak metacognitive skills can undermine performance.

First, you will learn the various parts of both desktop and laptop computers. Next, you will discover basic terms that are associated with computers, such as hardware, software, and firmware. You will learn the most basic functions of a computer: input, output, storage, and processing. Next, you will explore various input and output interfaces on the computer and the associated cables. Finally, you will review connections between common peripherals and discuss the standard ports. \n fuctions of computers:Input,Output,Storge,and Processing \n What makes a computer a computer? Does a computer have to have certain pieces to be considered a computer? Consider the computers of the 1980s: they all included a display screen, a keyboard, and a processing unit. Over time, the computers have evolved into devices that do not look like a “typical” computer. Consider the iPhone or Android tablet, where the method of input relies on touch, without the use of a separate keyboard. How about the calculator watch displayed below; is it a computer? \n Calculator watch. Photo\xa0used\xa0under\xa0CC-BY-NC\xa0license\xa0from \xa0 Tim Deering \n Regardless of the \xa0 form factor \xa0 of the machine, four basic functions — input, output, storage, and processing — make a computer. Below is a display of how those functions work together. \n \n So, as we consider the history of computers and the future of computers, we must consider what is and what is not a computer. Obviously, our desktops and laptops are computers, since they perform the input, processing, output, and storage functions. But so also are our cellular phones and smartphones, since they perform all these functions. What about our televisions? Many of these are complex computers as well, since they take information from our input using the remote control, process the information, and return an output, such as an on-demand movie. Many of these televisions also store the information, such as your favorite channels or even the video content itself for later playback. Even some thermostats are computers, since they also perform these functions, such as the “smart thermostats,” like the NEST and other popular brands. Remember, the main determination of whether something is a computer or not relies on the functions it performs: does it perform input, processing, output, and storage? If so, then it is a computer. \n Read more about different types of computers \xa0 here .', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH1.html'}, {'title': 'PCH2', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH2.html'}, {'title': 'PCH3', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH3.html'}, {'title': 'Kaggle', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Kaggle.html'}, {'title': 'cp2020', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'cp2020.html'}, {'title': '問題排除', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '問題排除.html'}, {'title': '1 heading問題', 'text': '已知heading無法使用標點符號作為標題 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '1 heading問題.html'}, {'title': '2 提醒', 'text': '根據嘗試遠端更新資料速度貌似要過好幾分鐘才會更新 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '2 提醒.html'}, {'title': '3 user內容的方式', 'text': '.gitconfig若要新增username跟usergmail還是以指令輸入較好，貌似就算格式符合手動輸入依然跟指令輸入有些不同(PS即便我自己是手動添加但其他同學卻出現讀不出來的情況)，會出現無法使用的name和gmail並叫我以指令添加，目前無法得知手動輸入和指令輸入的差別或自行輸入錯誤，但用指令輸入並無其他問題算是排除 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '3 user內容的方式.html'}, {'title': '4 github page not updating', 'text': '再上傳3.問題時由於我將內文設定成heading並且此內容裡正好包含標點符號，所以合理猜測由於跟1.問題符合導致東西在PUSH上去時可能無法讀取或錯誤進而導致靜態網頁內容更改但遠端網站的setting無法成功(若要成功必須有 GitHub Pages successfully built your site.跟 GitHub Pages successfully built your site.就是綠勾勾的出現)，所以即便倉儲的東西及標籤都是最新的但網站setting並不符合或承認此內容資料，將內文的heading的設定消除掉後重新PUSH上去就沒問題，起初以為是設定有動到所以上網找資料查詢但發現都是updataing網站更新數據問題，但我並未出現404錯誤所以我就往是否為我PUSH上去的內容有不符合或錯誤來實驗並最後得出此答案，問題解除 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '4 github page not updating.html'}, {'title': '5 網站編輯器無法開啟', 'text': '因為不明原因，導致編輯器無法啟動變成只打開原始代碼，先將目錄換到cmsimde用git pull將最新版代替舊版，將新的cmsimde代替原本的來解決 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '5 網站編輯器無法開啟.html'}, {'title': '6', 'text': '\n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '6.html'}, {'title': '教學歷程', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '教學歷程.html'}, {'title': 'W1至W8', 'text': '1.網路的一些性質及介紹等(proxy,ipv6,ipv4等) 2.利用kaggle進行網路上的程式編寫練習 3.Github,gitter,Heroku,等之間的使用方法及目的: 基本來說利用USB或者電腦本身進行寫程式(近端)，不只讓他保存並將其推到網路上(遠端)以實現多重保障並也能讓其他人觀看自己的作品，方便之後若有需要時不會發生資料遺漏或者資料不小心遺失也能搶救。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W1至W8.html'}, {'title': 'W8 test', 'text': '\n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W8 test.html'}, {'title': 'W9', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W9.html'}]};
