Each module has features designed to support you as an independent learner, including: \n \n Learning Objectives: \xa0 These are descriptions of what you should be able to do at the end of a section. A Learning Objective will allow you to direct your learning efforts and enable you to monitor your progress as you explore the content and engage in the activities. \n Explanatory Content: \xa0 This is the informational “meat” of every chapter. Consisting of short passages of text with information, examples, images, and explanations, this explanatory content contains pieces such as:\n \n Walk-throughs: \xa0 These are videos embedded in the pages to exemplify the concepts you are exploring. They may provide a more detailed explanation of a topic or guide you through the steps of a process. \n Examples: \xa0 Designed to illustrate specific applications of the skills and learning objectives that the course supports you to achieve. \n Labs: \xa0 Simulations and lab activities designed to give you an opportunity to interact with various hardware elements. \n Many Students Wonder sidebars: \xa0 These sidebars serve two purposes: (1) to give a quick review of concepts, such as "highly specialized input devices," that are used in the PC Hardware material and (2) to provide additional material or background information that you may find surprising and interesting but that is not going to be assessed in the Quiz. \n \n \n Learning Activities: \xa0 There are different types of activities interspersed throughout the course. They include:\n \n Learn By Doing activities: \xa0 Learn By Doing activities follow the short explanations and examples. These activities give you the chance to investigate and practice key ideas. Learn By Doing activities have hints and feedback to guide you if you need it. \n Did I Get This? activities: \xa0 Did I Get This? activities are your chance to do a quick "self-check." These activities do not have hints, and often follow a Learn by Doing activity so that you can determine if you understand the key ideas. This will help you make sure you are ready for graded activities. \n Quizzes: \xa0 These are short assignments that are graded. There is a Quiz at the end of each Module. The Quiz will show you and your instructor how well you understand the key concepts. If you read the information and do the activities in each Module, you should be ready for the Quiz. \n \n \n Metacognitive Activities: \xa0 These activities are designed to support your development as an independent learner, encouraging you to reflect on your progress and plan for continuing success. These activities include:\n \n My Response activities: \xa0 These short activities are located at the end of the module; they encourage you to reflect on your progress through the module and estimate how well you believe you\'ve attained the module\'s learning objectives. These activities also provide a place to share continuing questions and areas of difficulty (if you\'re using the course in conjunction with an instructor, your questions will be shared with your instructor). \n Checkpoints: \xa0 These activities are located across the course after sections of content that can be particularly challenging or require additional practice. These metacognitive \xa0 checkpoints encourage you to review your progress so far and assess yourself: are you ready to continue, or do you believe you need additional materials, practice, or self-assessment? If you feel that you\'re not ready to proceed, these checkpoints provide links to additional learning materials. \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'What You Need to Know About the Course.html'}, {'title': 'About These Materials', 'text': '©2016 \xa0 Cyber Pathways Across Maryland . \n Unless otherwise specified, CPAM materials are licensed under a \xa0 Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License . \n This workforce solution was funded by a grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration.
