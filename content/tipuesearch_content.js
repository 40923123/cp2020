It involves five distinct skills:\n \n Assessing the task. \n Evaluating your strengths and weaknesses. \n Planning an approach. \n Applying strategies and monitoring your performance. \n Reflecting and adjusting if needed. \n \n \n \n \n \n The diagram below shows you one example of the metacognitive cycle. Hover over the individual skills to learn more. \n 元認知 （定義） 元認知或“思考”是您對自己作為學習者的意識以及對自己的學習進行調節的能力。 它涉及五個不同的技能： 1.評估任務。 2.評估您的優點和缺點。 3.規劃方法。 4.應用策略並監控績效。 5.反思並根據需要進行調整。 下圖顯示了元認知循環的一個示例。 將鼠標懸停在個人技能上以了解更多信息。 \n \n \n EXAMPLE \n \n Metacognition in Action \n \n You get an assignment and ask yourself: \n “What exactly does this assignment involve and what have I learned in this course that is relevant to it?” \n You are exercising metacognitive skills #1 and #2 by assessing the task and evaluating your strengths and weaknesses in relation to it. If you think about what steps you need to take to complete the assignment and determine when it is reasonable to begin, you are exercising skill #3 by planning. If you start in on your plan and realize that you are working more slowly than you anticipated, you are putting skill #4 to work by applying a strategy and monitoring your performance. Finally, if you reflect on your performance in relation to your time frame for the task, and discover an equally effective but more efficient way to work, you are engaged in skill #5 of reflecting and adjusting your approach as needed. \n Metacognition is not rocket science. In some respects, it is fairly ordinary and intuitive. Yet you’d be surprised how often people lack strong metacognitive skills, and you’d be amazed by how much weak metacognitive skills can undermine performance. To test your own powers of metacognition, read each of the scenarios below and identify which metacognitive skill the student is struggling with. \n 行動中的元認知 您得到一個作業並問自己： \n “這項作業確切涉及什麼，我在本課程中從中學到了什麼？” \n 您正在通過評估任務並評估與之相關的優缺點來鍛煉第一和第二元認知技能。如果您考慮需要採取什麼步驟來完成作業並確定何時開始合理的訓練，那麼您正在通過計劃來鍛煉技能3。如果您按計劃開始工作，並且意識到自己的工作速度比預期的要慢，那麼您將通過應用策略和監控績效來使技能4發揮作用。最後，如果您根據任務的時間框架來反思自己的績效，並發現一種同樣有效但更有效的工作方式，那麼您將掌握技巧五，根據需要進行反思和調整。 \n 元認知不是火箭科學。在某些方面，它是相當普通和直觀的。但是，您會驚訝於人們經常缺乏強大的元認知能力，而您會驚訝於元認知能力薄弱會損害績效。要測試您自己的元認知能力，請閱讀以下每種情況，並確定學生正在努力使用的元認知技能。 \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'About These Materials.html'}, {'title': 'unit2 hardware basice', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'unit2 hardware basice.html'}, {'title': 'PCH1 The Basics', 'text': 'introduction \n This lesson will cover the basics of PC Hardware.

You will learn the most basic functions of a computer: input, output, storage, and processing. Next, you will explore various input and output interfaces on the computer and the associated cables. Finally, you will review connections between common peripherals and discuss the standard ports. \n 介紹 本課將介紹PC硬件的基礎知識。 首先，您將學習台式計算機和便攜式計算機的各個部分。 接下來，您將發現與計算機關聯的基本術語，例如硬件，軟件和固件。 您將學習計算機的最基本功能：輸入，輸出，存儲和處理。 接下來，您將探索計算機上的各種輸入和輸出接口以及相關的電纜。 最後，您將回顧通用外設之間的連接並討論標準端口。 \n fuctions of computers:Input,Output,Storge,and Processing \n What makes a computer a computer? Does a computer have to have certain pieces to be considered a computer? Consider the computers of the 1980s: they all included a display screen, a keyboard, and a processing unit. Over time, the computers have evolved into devices that do not look like a “typical” computer. Consider the iPhone or Android tablet, where the method of input relies on touch, without the use of a separate keyboard. How about the calculator watch displayed below; is it a computer? \n 計算機功能：輸入，輸出，存儲和處理 是什麼使計算機成為計算機？ 一台計算機是否必須具有某些部件才能視為計算機？ 考慮一下1980年代的計算機：它們都包括顯示屏，鍵盤和處理單元。 隨著時間的流逝，計算機已經演變為看起來不像“典型”計算機的設備。 考慮iPhone或Android平板電腦，其中輸入方法依靠觸摸，而不使用單獨的鍵盤。 下面顯示的計算器手錶怎麼樣？ 是電腦嗎？ \n \n Calculator watch. Photo\xa0used\xa0under\xa0CC-BY-NC\xa0license\xa0from \xa0 Tim Deering \n Regardless of the \xa0 form factor \xa0 of the machine, four basic functions — input, output, storage, and processing — make a computer. Below is a display of how those functions work together. \n 計算器手錶。 照片由Tim Deering根據CC-BY-NC許可使用 不論機器的外形尺寸如何，計算機都具有四個基本功能（輸入，輸出，存儲和處理）。 下面顯示了這些功能如何協同工作。 \n \n So, as we consider the history of computers and the future of computers, we must consider what is and what is not a computer. Obviously, our desktops and laptops are computers, since they perform the input, processing, output, and storage functions. But so also are our cellular phones and smartphones, since they perform all these functions. What about our televisions? Many of these are complex computers as well, since they take information from our input using the remote control, process the information, and return an output, such as an on-demand movie. Many of these televisions also store the information, such as your favorite channels or even the video content itself for later playback. Even some thermostats are computers, since they also perform these functions, such as the “smart thermostats,” like the NEST and other popular brands. Remember, the main determination of whether something is a computer or not relies on the functions it performs: does it perform input, processing, output, and storage? If so, then it is a computer. \n Read more about different types of computers \xa0 here . \n 因此，當我們考慮計算機的歷史和計算機的未來時，我們必須考慮什麼是計算機，什麼不是計算機。顯然，我們的台式機和筆記本電腦是計算機，因為它們執行輸入，處理，輸出和存儲功能。但是，由於我們的手機和智能手機執行所有這些功能，所以它們也是如此。那我們的電視呢？其中許多都是複雜的計算機，因為它們使用遙控器從我們的輸入中獲取信息，處理信息並返回輸出，例如點播電影。這些電視中的許多電視也會存儲信息，例如您喜歡的頻道，甚至是視頻內容本身，以供以後播放。甚至某些恆溫器都是計算機，因為它們也執行這些功能，例如NEST和其他流行品牌的“智能恆溫器”。記住，確定某物是否為計算機的主要決定因素是其執行的功能：它執行輸入，處理，輸出和存儲嗎？如果是這樣，則它是一台計算機。 \n 在此處閱讀有關不同類型計算機的更多信息。 \n Hardware \n A computer system includes hardware, software, and firmware. To build a computer, we must first gather the required hardware. The hardware is the part of the computer that you can touch and feel. When most people see a typical computer, they understand that there are physical components to what they are using, such as the the hard metallic or plastic System unit, central processing unit (CPU), power supply, disk drives, and other essential components. Hardware is limited by its manufacture date and specifically by the motherboard installed. Depending on age and availability, some of the hardware items may be expensive to acquire, repair, or replace. For example, if the computer is running slower over time as you add newer software, it may be necessary to increase the amount of physical memory, called \xa0 RAM \xa0 (random access memory), in the computer. In order to do this, the technician would need to purchase the correct size, speed, and style of memory according to the motherboard specifications and install it in the computer which will then enhance its ability to process information more quickly. \n 硬件 計算機系統包括硬件，軟件和固件。要構建計算機，我們必須首先收集所需的硬件。硬件是您可以觸摸和感覺到的計算機的一部分。當大多數人看到一台典型的計算機時，他們就會知道所使用的是物理組件，例如，硬金屬或塑料系統單元，中央處理器（CPU），電源，磁盤驅動器和其他必要組件。硬件受製造日期限制，特別是受安裝的主板限制。根據使用年限和可用性，某些硬件項目的購置，維修或更換可能會很昂貴。例如，如果在添加新軟件時計算機運行速度隨著時間的推移變慢，則可能有必要增加計算機中稱為RAM（隨機存取存儲器）的物理內存量。為此，技術人員需要根據主板規格購買正確的大小，速度和內存類型，然後將其安裝在計算機中，這將增強其更快地處理信息的能力。 \n Computer hardware consists of the mechanical and electrical parts of the computer. Data flows through the motherboard in what is known as the system bus. External ports, which are discussed in more detail further in this lesson, allow peripheral devices to be connected to the system unit. Common ports are USB, serial, and parallel ports. \n Peripheral devices consist of hardware attached to the system unit and are designated as input, output, or both. Traditional input device examples are the mouse and keyboard which are used to input data. \n 計算機硬件由計算機的機械和電氣部分組成。 數據以所謂的系統總線流經母板。 在本課程中將進一步詳細討論的外部端口允許將外圍設備連接到系統單元。 通用端口是USB，串行和並行端口。 \n 外圍設備由連接到系統單元的硬件組成，並被指定為輸入，輸出或兩者。 傳統的輸入設備示例是用於輸入數據的鼠標和鍵盤。 \n \n Input devices: keyboard and mouse. Photo used under CC-BY-NC-ND license from \xa0 Ben Ward . \n Output devices consist of common items such as monitors, speakers, and printers. All of these devices are ways that the computer can give feedback to the user through either visual or auditory output. \n Traditionally singular devices have evolved to become both input and output. Gaming Joysticks which provide feedback to the user through vibrations and of course the touch-screen display now serve as both. \n 輸入設備：鍵盤和鼠標。 本照片由Ben Ward根據CC-BY-NC-ND許可使用。 輸出設備由通用項目組成，例如監視器，揚聲器和打印機。 所有這些設備都是計算機可以通過視覺或聽覺輸出向用戶提供反饋的方式。 \n 傳統上，單個設備已演變為輸入和輸出。 通過振動向用戶提供反饋的遊戲操縱桿，當然觸摸屏顯示器現在兼用作兩者。 \n \n Output devices: monitor and speaker. Photo used under CC-BY-SA license from \xa0 William Hook . \n software \n Software is completely intangible and cannot be physically touched. Software, in its purest form, is a series of 1s and 0s (bits) that make up the code that gives the computer its instructions on how to perform a certain task. While you may be able to touch the media on which the software is stored (like a CD or DVD), you cannot really touch the software code itself. \n 軟件 軟件是完全無形的，不能被實際觸摸。 最純粹形式的軟件是由一系列1和0（位）組成的代碼，這些代碼向計算機提供有關如何執行特定任務的指令。 雖然您可以觸摸存儲軟件的介質（例如CD或DVD），但實際上不能觸摸軟件代碼本身。 \n The most basic software that a computer requires is the operating system. There are numerous operating systems on the market today, including various versions of Microsoft Windows, Macintosh OS X, Linux, Android, and iOS, to name just a few. The operating system provides the standard methods for saving, retrieving, changing, printing, and transmitting information in the computer. Operating systems contain internal commands, which are programs that are built into the operating system to perform basic tasks such as file management (delete, copy, and rename files). Additionally, operating systems also contain external commands, which are added programs to complete more complicated functions, such as defragmentation of a hard drive or handling the remote control of another computer on the network. \n 計算機所需的最基本的軟件是操作系統。 當今市場上有許多操作系統，其中包括Microsoft Windows，Macintosh OS X，Linux，Android和iOS的各種版本。 操作系統提供了用於在計算機中保存，檢索，更改，打印和傳輸信息的標準方法。 操作系統包含內部命令，這些內部命令是操作系統中內置的用於執行基本任務（例如文件管理（刪除，複製和重命名文件））的程序。 此外，操作系統還包含外部命令，這些命令是添加的程序，可以完成更複雜的功能，例如對硬盤驅動器進行碎片整理或處理網絡上另一台計算機的遠程控制。 \n Finally, there are software programs called applications. These programs are used to create, store, modify, and view information that you create. Applications, such as Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat, allow you to read and create documents and presentations. Other applications, such as games and web browsers, may instead be used for entertainment. \n 最後，有稱為應用程序的軟件程序。 這些程序用於創建，存儲，修改和查看您創建的信息。 諸如Microsoft Office或Adobe Acrobat之類的應用程序允許您閱讀和創建文檔和演示文稿。 可以將其他應用程序（例如游戲和Web瀏覽器）用於娛樂。 \n \n \n firmware \n \n \n \n \n \n Firmware is a combination of hardware and software, often called “software on a chip.” Firmware allows control of the device to which the chip is connected. A firmware chip contains specialized software and is often attached to motherboards, optical drives (such as CD, DVD, or Blu-ray), mass storage devices, and other specialized hardware. \n 固件 固件是硬件和軟件的組合，通常稱為“芯片上的軟件”。 固件允許控制芯片所連接的設備。 固件芯片包含專用軟件，通常連接到主板，光盤驅動器（例如CD，DVD或藍光），大容量存儲設備和其他專用硬件。 \n In older generations of firmware, the firmware was not upgradable unless you replaced the physical chip, but in recent years firmware has been designed to be “flashable.” This means that the chip can be upgraded if the software is outdated or has a programming error. This firmware “flash” replaces the older software on the chip with the latest version, improving performance or enhancing security. \n 在較早版本的固件中，除非更換了物理芯片，否則固件無法升級，但是近年來，固件被設計為“可閃存”。 這意味著，如果軟件過時或出現編程錯誤，則可以升級芯片。 該固件“閃存”用最新版本替換了芯片上的舊軟件，從而提高了性能或增強了安全性。 \n The most common type of firmware found in a computer is called the BIOS (basic input/output system), which provides the computer with the most basic of tasks before the operating system is even loaded. Without the BIOS, the computer would be rather useless, as it wouldn’t even be able to read the hard drive and load the operating system. Firmware is persistent: it remains on the chip even after the power is removed, unlike temporary storage (such as RAM). \n 計算機中最常見的固件類型稱為BIOS（基本輸入/輸出系統），BIOS甚至在加載操作系統之前就為計算機提供了最基本的任務。 如果沒有BIOS，計算機將毫無用處，因為它甚至無法讀取硬盤驅動器並加載操作系統。 固件具有持久性：與臨時存儲（例如RAM）不同，固件即使在斷電後仍保留在芯片上。 \n Componentization Standardization \n Componentization is the process of breaking down large and complex items into simple, reusable, and interchangeable pieces. For many years, computer software and hardware were made by individual companies building things that only worked for a single system. For example, if IBM made a network card, it would not work in a Compaq or Dell computer. Over the years, hardware developers realized that if they could agree to a set of standards, they could create components that could be built to work together using standard interfaces, which saves time, money, and complexity. This same concept is now being used in the software world under object-oriented programming — a standardized method of programming. \n 組件標準化 組件化是將大型和復雜項目分解為簡單，可重用和可互換的部分的過程。 多年來，計算機軟件和硬件是由獨立的公司製造的，這些公司只能在單個系統上工作。 例如，如果IBM製作了網卡，則它不能在Compaq或Dell計算機中工作。 多年以來，硬件開發人員意識到，如果他們同意一套標準，他們可以創建可以使用標準接口構建為可以協同工作的組件，從而節省了時間，金錢和復雜性。 現在，在面向對象的程序設計（一種標準化的程序設計方法）下的軟件世界中使用了相同的概念。 \n Standardization allows for a set of rules that everyone can follow so that hardware is interoperable and software is interoperable. This increases the ability to have componentization of hardware and software, since the input and output created are standardized. For example, web pages are coded in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which all web browsers understand. Therefore, the user can use any web browser and still get the content they are interested in viewing because of the standardization of the system. \n 標準化允許每個人都可以遵循一組規則，以便硬件可互操作，軟件可互操作。 由於創建的輸入和輸出是標準化的，因此這提高了對硬件和軟件進行組件化的能力。 例如，網頁以HTML（超文本標記語言）編碼，所有網絡瀏覽器都可以理解。 因此，由於系統的標準化，用戶可以使用任何Web瀏覽器，並且仍然可以獲得他們感興趣的內容。 \n Connection interfaces and cables \n When looking at a customer’s personal computer, you must be able to easily identify the various components that make up the computer by sight. As you look at the image of the computer, you notice the various parts, such as the CD/DVD drive and the memory card reader bay. Both of these components would be classified as part of the storage subsystem. The headphone jack is used for audio output, while the microphone jack is used for audio input. The USB and FireWire ports are used for both input and output, as well as storage, depending on the device that is connected to the port. For example, if we connect a printer to the USB port, it would be used for output, but if we instead connected a mouse to the USB port, it would be used for input. \n 連接接口和電纜 查看客戶的個人計算機時，您必須能夠通過視線輕鬆識別組成計算機的各種組件。 當您查看計算機的圖像時，會注意到各個部分，例如CD / DVD驅動器和存儲卡讀取器托架。 這兩個組件都將歸類為存儲子系統的一部分。 耳機插孔用於音頻輸出，而麥克風插孔用於音頻輸入。 USB和FireWire端口用於輸入和輸出以及存儲，具體取決於連接到端口的設備。 例如，如果我們將打印機連接到USB端口，它將用於輸出，但是如果我們將鼠標連接到USB端口，則它將用於輸入。 \n Connections Between Common Peripherals and Standard Ports \n The peripherals connect to the computer via standard ports. Ports allow for information to flow into or out of the computer as part of the input and output subsystems. External devices, such as keyboards, mice, printers, scanners, storage devices, monitors, and others can connect to the computer through various types of cables, which connect to specific ports. On most modern systems, this has been reduced down to a common, standard interface, the universal serial bus port (USB port). Older systems have various ports for various functions, which are now referred to as legacy ports, such as PS/2, serial, and parallel ports. They were difficult to configure and required hardware resources to be dedicated to them, such as interrupt requests, direct memory access, and specific I/O (input/output) port addresses. In USB, this is all handled by the operating system automatically. This makes hardware conflicts rare in current systems. Many customers will still have computers with legacy ports. So, it is important to understand multiple ports and connections. \n 通用外設與標準端口之間的連接 \n 外圍設備通過標準端口連接到計算機。端口允許信息作為輸入和輸出子系統的一部分流入或流出計算機。外部設備（例如鍵盤，鼠標，打印機，掃描儀，存儲設備，顯示器和其他設備）可以通過各種類型的電纜連接到計算機，這些電纜連接到特定的端口。在大多數現代系統上，這已簡化為通用的標準接口，即通用串行總線端口（USB端口）。較舊的系統具有用於各種功能的各種端口，這些端口現在稱為傳統端口，例如PS / 2，串行和並行端口。它們很難配置，並且需要專用於它們的硬件資源，例如中斷請求，直接內存訪問和特定的I / O（輸入/輸出）端口地址。在USB中，這全部由操作系統自動處理。這使得在當前系統中很少發生硬件衝突。許多客戶仍將擁有帶有舊版端口的計算機。因此，了解多個端口和連接很重要。 \n The photo below offers a close-up view of a motherboard’s port cluster. \n \n Port cluster photo used under CC-BY license from \xa0 Edmund Tse .

Things like printers and scanners, which once used parallel or SCSI ports, now use USB as well. Small computer system interface (SCSI) is a set of parallel interface standards developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for attaching printers, disk drives, scanners and other peripherals to computers. SCSI (pronounced "skuzzy") is supported by all major operating systems. USB began with version 1.1, which provided two speeds of operations: low-speed (1.5 Mbps for input devices such as mice/keyboards) and full-speed (12 Mbps for other devices, such as webcams, digital cameras, scanners, and printers). USB 2.0 further increased speed to what is known as high-speed or hi-speed (480 Mbps), allowing for USB to provide faster access to external storage devices such as hard drives, helping to replace SCSI and FireWire ports. USB 3.0, the current version, is known as superspeed, because it provides up to 5 Gbps of bandwidth for very fast access to external devices and can be identified by the blue color. Newer versions of USB are backward compatible with older versions, but you should not connect different versions of USB on the same port, as this slows the port down to the lowest version. For example, if you plug in a four-port USB hub to a USB 3.0 port, but then connect a USB 1.1 mouse to the hub, the entire four-port hub will now run at a maximum speed of 12 Mbps (USB 1.1 speeds). Each USB port can be daisy-chained to provide up to 127 devices per port, using USB hubs. \n 鼠標和鍵盤等以前使用PS / 2或串行端口的設備現在使用USB。曾經使用並行或SCSI端口的打印機和掃描儀之類的東西現在也使用USB。小型計算機系統接口（SCSI）是由美國國家標準協會（ANSI）開發的一組並行接口標準，用於將打印機，磁盤驅動器，掃描儀和其他外圍設備連接到計算機。所有主要操作系統都支持SCSI（讀作“ skuzzy”）。 USB從版本1.1開始，提供兩種運行速度：低速（對於鼠標/鍵盤等輸入設備為1.5 Mbps）和全速（對於網絡攝像頭，數碼相機，掃描儀和打印機等其他設備為12 Mbps） ）。 USB 2.0將速度進一步提高到所謂的高速或高速（480 Mbps），從而使USB可以更快地訪問外部存儲設備（例如硬盤驅動器），從而幫助替換SCSI和FireWire端口。當前版本的USB 3.0被稱為超高速，因為它提供高達5 Gbps的帶寬，可以非常快速地訪問外部設備，並且可以通過藍色識別。較新版本的USB向後兼容較舊版本的USB，但是您不應在同一端口上連接不同版本的USB，因為這會將端口速度降低到最低版本。例如，如果將四端口USB集線器插入USB 3.0端口，然後將USB 1.1鼠標連接到集線器，則整個四端口集線器現在將以12 Mbps的最大速度運行（USB 1.1速度）。每個USB端口都可以使用USB集線器進行菊花鏈連接，以每個端口提供多達127個設備。 \n USB cables should be kept under three meters (approximately nine feet) in length for USB 1.1 and 3.0. For the USB 2.0 variant, you can use cables up to five meters (approximately 15 feet) without issues. If you use cables longer than the recommended length, you may get errors in your input/output over USB, so it is best to keep the USB cables short. If you need a longer cable run, you must use a hub as a repeater to help boost the power signal over the USB cable. There are two types of hubs: self-powered and bus-powered. Self-powered hubs have their own power adapter and connect to the wall outlet to provide power to the hub. Bus-powered are instead powered solely from the source USB port that they are connected to on the computer. This provides minimal amperage for the devices connected to the USB hub that can cause issues when connecting multiple hubs to each other. For connection of multiple hubs, it is best practice to use self-powered hubs. Each USB port can support up to 127 different devices in the chain, with the root hub for the computer having two ports directly connected to the motherboard. If you need more USB ports, you can do this by adding hubs (self-powered or bus-powered), using motherboard USB header cables, or adding expansion cards that contain more USB ports. \n 對於USB 1.1和3.0，USB電纜的長度應保持在三米（約9英尺）以下。對於USB 2.0版本，您可以使用最長5米（約15英尺）的電纜而不會出現問題。如果使用的電纜長度超過建議的長度，則通過USB的輸入/輸出可能會出現錯誤，因此最好使USB電纜的長度短。如果需要較長的電纜，則必須使用集線器作為中繼器，以幫助增強USB電纜上的電源信號。集線器有兩種類型：自供電和總線供電。自供電的集線器具有自己的電源適配器，並連接至壁裝電源插座，以為集線器供電。總線供電僅由它們在計算機上連接的源USB端口供電。這為連接到USB集線器的設備提供了最小的電流強度，當將多個集線器彼此連接時會引起問題。對於連接多個集線器，最佳做法是使用自供電集線器。每個USB端口可在鏈中最多支持127個不同的設備，計算機的根集線器具有兩個直接連接至主板的端口。如果需要更多USB端口，可以通過添加集線器（自供電或總線供電），使用主板USB接頭連接器電纜或添加包含更多USB端口的擴展卡來實現。 \n Caption: USB hub.

Recently, these ports have been replaced by USB in most machines. These ports, though, are color-coded for the device which they are intended to be used with. The keyboard port is colored purple, and the mouse port is colored green. Even though these ports look identical, they are not interchangeable. If you plug a mouse into the keyboard port, it simply won’t work. Additionally, unlike USB, these ports are not hot-swappable. Instead, you must restart the machine after plugging the device in for the computer to recognize the new mouse or keyboard. \n PS / 2 PS / 2端口，也稱為mini-DIN端口，在過去十年中一直廣泛用於鍵盤和鼠標。 最近，在大多數機器中，這些端口已被USB取代。 但是，這些端口已針對要使用的設備進行了顏色編碼。 鍵盤端口為紫色，鼠標端口為綠色。 即使這些端口看起來相同，也不能互換。 如果將鼠標插入鍵盤端口，則根本無法使用。 此外，與USB不同，這些端口不可熱插拔。 而是必須在插入設備後重新啟動機器，計算機才能識別新的鼠標或鍵盤。 \n \n \n PS/2 ports.

FireWire is a high-speed, bidirectional, serial transmission port used to connect PCs to each other, or devices to PCs. It was introduced during the days of USB 1.1 as a faster alternative, since USB 1.1 had a maximum speed of 12 Mbps and FireWire has a maximum speed of 400 Mbps under IEEE 1394a (FireWire 400) and 800 Mbps under IEEE 1394b (Firewire 800). Common uses for FireWire were to connect to external storage devices and digital media devices, such as video cameras. Most FireWire devices have two FireWire ports to allow for daisy-chaining of the devices, which supports up to 16 devices per FireWire port without any degradation. FireWire remains popular with Mac OS X, but has lost much of its popularity with the introduction of USB 3.0, since the speed is much quicker with USB 3.0. \n 火線 FireWire最初是由Apple開發並流行為USB的挑戰者和SCSI的替代品。 FireWire是一個高速雙向串行傳輸端口，用於將PC彼此連接，或將設備連接至PC。 由於USB 1.1的最高速度為12 Mbps，而FireWire在IEEE 1394a（FireWire 400）下為400 Mbps，在IEEE 1394b（Firewire 800）下為800 Mbps，因此它是USB 1.1的最快替代產品。 。 FireWire的常見用途是連接到外部存儲設備和數字媒體設備，例如攝像機。 大多數FireWire設備都有兩個FireWire端口，以實現設備的菊花鏈連接，每個FireWire端口最多可支持16個設備，而不會降低性能。 FireWire在Mac OS X上仍然很流行，但是由於USB 3.0的速度要快得多，因此在引入USB 3.0時已經失去了很多流行性。 \n \n FireWire card.

It is used to connect hard disk drives, tape drives, ZIP drives, JAZ drives, scanners, optical drives (CD/DVD), and printers to a computer both internally and externally. SCSI is found mainly in servers for hard disk drives and tape drives, but was sometimes found in older workstations in the 1990s. SCSI supports daisy-chaining and was the precursor to FireWire. SCSI can be narrow (supporting up to seven devices on a single port) or wide (supporting up to 15 devices on a single port). SCSI also requires that a unique ID be assigned to each device in the chain, so the computer knows which device is which. This is accomplished using either a \xa0 DIP switchor jumper that assigns a unique ID of 0-15 (for wide), or 0-7 (for narrow). Finally, each chain must have a termination plug to signify the end of the SCSI chain. SCSI chains can contain many devices of mixed speeds, but this causes the whole “chain” to default to the slowest device. Speed for SCSI ranges from 10 Mbps to 320 Mbps. Since the advent of FireWire, SCSI has lost popularity as an external port for storage devices. Internally, SCSI has been replaced by the SATA[KK1] connector, which we will discuss in the section on storage later in the course. \n SCSI SCSI代表小型計算機系統接口，並且是舊版連接器。它用於將硬盤驅動器，磁帶驅動器，ZIP驅動器，JAZ驅動器，掃描儀，光盤驅動器（CD / DVD）和打印機內部和外部連接到計算機。 SCSI主要在用於硬盤驅動器和磁帶驅動器的服務器中找到，但有時在1990年代在較舊的工作站中也可以找到。 SCSI支持菊花鏈，並且是FireWire的前身。 SCSI可以很窄（在單個端口上最多支持七個設備）或很寬（在單個端口上最多支持15個設備）。 SCSI還要求將唯一的ID分配給鏈中的每個設備，以便計算機知道哪個設備是哪個設備。這可以通過使用DIP切換器跳線來實現，該跳線將唯一ID分配為0-15（對於寬）或0-7（對於窄）。最後，每個鏈必須有一個端接插頭以表示SCSI鏈的末端。 SCSI鏈可能包含許多混合速度的設備，但這會導致整個“鏈”默認為最慢的設備。 SCSI的速度範圍從10 Mbps到320 Mbps。自FireWire出現以來，SCSI作為存儲設備的外部端口已不再流行。在內部，SCSI已由SATA [KK1]連接器取代，我們將在本課程稍後的存儲部分中討論該連接器。 \n \n Two blue SCSI ports.

They were often used for external modems, mice, trackballs, touchpads, plotters, label printers, dot-matrix printers, PDA (Palm Pilot) docking stations, digital cameras, and PC-to-PC connections. USB has replaced serial ports for all of these uses in modern computers, but some people still have a need for a serial port. If your computer doesn’t have a serial port (which is very common in modern machines), you can add one using an expansion card or a USB to serial adapter. Serial ports come in two varieties: DB-25 (containing 25 pins) and DB-9 (containing nine pins). The DB-9 variety is the most common in use. Serial ports are generally slow, since they send data one bit at a time over the wire. There is no standard serial cable pinout; instead, they are created for the application they are used for, such as a null-modem cable to connect two computers directly, or a modem cable to connect the computer to an external modem. The most common variety of serial cable in use today is the CISCO rollover cable, which has a nine-pin serial port on one end and an RJ-45 connector (like a network cable) on the other end. This cable is used to connect a computer to a CISCO router or switch for configuration tasks. \n 串口 串行端口，也稱為COM或RS-232端口，在1980年代和1990年代被大量用於串行通信，作為輸入/輸出端口。它們通常用於外部調製解調器，鼠標，軌跡球，觸摸板，繪圖儀，標籤打印機，點矩陣打印機，PDA（Palm Pilot）擴展塢，數碼相機以及PC到PC的連接。 USB已取代了現代計算機中所有這些用途的串行端口，但是有些人仍然需要串行端口。如果您的計算機沒有串行端口（這在現代計算機中很常見），則可以使用擴展卡或USB到串行適配器添加一個。串行端口有兩種：DB-25（包含25個引腳）和DB-9（包含9個引腳）。 DB-9品種是最常用的品種。串行端口通常很慢，因為它們一次通過有線發送數據一位。沒有標準的串行電纜引出線。而是為它們所使用的應用程序創建它們，例如直接連接兩台計算機的零調製解調器電纜，或將計算機連接到外部調製解調器的調製解調器電纜。當今使用的最常見的串行電纜是CISCO翻轉電纜，其一端有一個9針串行端口，而另一端有一個RJ-45連接器（如網絡電纜）。該電纜用於將計算機連接到CISCO路由器或交換機以執行配置任務。 \n Serial cable connector.

They were often used for printers and scanners. USB has replaced parallel ports for all of these uses in modern computers, and few people will still have a need for a parallel port in contemporary computing. If your computer doesn’t have a parallel port (which is very common in modern machines), you could add one using an expansion card or a USB to parallel adapter. Parallel ports come in a standard DB-25 (containing 25 pins) cable. Other varieties of cables exist, including a DB-25 to Centronics 36-pin cable (common with printers), DB-25 to DB-25 cable (common with switchboxes), and DB-25 to DB-25 with the transmit/receive pins reversed (common for computer to computer connections for data transfer). Parallel ports are generally faster than serial ports, since they send data in parallel with eight bits at a time going over the wire. Parallel ports can be configured as output only or bidirectional ports. The ports are also configured as EPP (enhanced parallel port), ECP (enhanced capabilities port), and EPP/ECP. Under EPP, the port uses interrupt request (IRQ) and I/O addresses for fastest speeds. In ECP, the port can support daisy-chaining of devices and uses IRQ, I/O address, and DMA channels, and is considered resource hungry. EPP/ECP combines both modes into a single configuration, allowing for maximum compatibility. Parallel ports transmit data at up to two Mbps and receive data at 500 Kbps, which is very slow by today’s standards. \n 並行端口 並行端口，也稱為LPT（行式打印機終端）端口，在1980年代和1990年代大量用於並行通信，作為輸入/輸出端口。它們通常用於打印機和掃描儀。 USB已經取代了並行端口，可用於現代計算機中的所有這些用途，當代計算機中仍然很少有人需要並行端口。如果您的計算機沒有並行端口（這在現代計算機中很常見），則可以使用擴展卡或USB到並行適配器添加一個。並行端口採用標準的DB-25（包含25針）電纜。還存在其他種類的電纜，包括DB-25至Centronics 36針電纜（與打印機共用），DB-25至DB-25電纜（與配電箱共用）以及具有發送/接收功能的DB-25至DB-25引腳顛倒（計算機到計算機的連接通常用於數據傳輸）。並行端口通常比串行端口快，因為並行端口一次通過8位並行發送數據。並行端口可以配置為僅輸出端口或雙向端口。這些端口還配置為EPP（增強型並行端口），ECP（增強功能端口）和EPP / ECP。在EPP下，端口使用中斷請求（IRQ）和I / O地址以獲得最快的速度。在ECP中，端口可以支持設備的菊花鏈連接，並使用IRQ，I / O地址和DMA通道，並且被認為是資源匱乏。 EPP / ECP將兩種模式組合為一個配置，以實現最大的兼容性。並行端口以高達2 Mbps的速率發送數據，並以500 Kbps的速率接收數據，按照當今的標準，這是非常慢的。 \n \n Parallel port.

First we will discuss the hazards of computer systems and tools, including electricity, electrostatic discharge (ESD), chemicals, and other dangers that can hurt you when you are working on the various forms of computer hardware. We will also cover the safety measures and procedures that you must employ to minimize risk, such as using ESD straps, ESD mats, self-grounding systems, and equipment grounding. We will then discuss personal safety, including removal of jewelry to protect yourself and computers, proper lifting techniques and weight limitations, and removal of electrical power. Finally, we will cover electrical fire safety, cathode ray tube (CRT) safety and disposal, cable management, and local government regulation compliance. \n 本課程涵蓋基本程序和安全預防措施，技術人員在使用各種PC硬件進行操作之前必須具備足夠的能力和舒適度。 首先，我們將討論計算機系統和工具的危害，包括電流，靜電釋放（ESD），化學物質以及在使用各種形式的計算機硬件時可能傷害您的其他危害。 我們還將介紹必須使用以最小化風險的安全措施和程序，例如使用ESD皮帶，ESD墊，自接地系統和設備接地。 然後，我們將討論人身安全，包括為保護自己和計算機而卸下珠寶，適當的起重技術和重量限制以及斷開電源。 最後，我們將涵蓋電氣消防安全，陰極射線管（CRT）安全和處置，電纜管理以及地方政府法規合規性。 \n Operational Procedures: Electrical Safety \n Electricity is a significant hazard in working with computer systems and tools. Electricity is required to make workstations operate, but if you are not careful, electricity can cause serious injury to you and major damage to the computer you are working on. \n 電力是使用計算機系統和工具的重大危險。 要使工作站正常工作，必須通電，但是如果不小心，電流可能會對您造成嚴重傷害，並嚴重損壞您正在使用的計算機。 \n With regard to human injury, technicians can receive an electrical shock from computers or electrical outlets if special care is not taken when working with them. It is important to check all the power outlets to ensure they are working properly. When checking the outlets, you should verify that the outlet is providing the correct amount of power. If you are working in the United States, then you should expect to receive a voltage of 115 VAC to 120 VAC (volts of alternating current) from the power outlets in an office or home. This can be verified using a simple three-prong tester, voltmeter, or multimeter. Procedurally, you must never pull the cords out by the wires, as this can cause damage and fraying of the cables. Instead, you should plug in and remove cables by the plug on the end of the cord. It is important that you never use a frayed or damaged power cable. \n 關於人身傷害，如果在操作計算機或電源插座時未特別注意，則技術人員可能會從計算機或電源插座中遭受電擊。 檢查所有電源插座以確保它們正常工作很重要。 檢查插座時，應驗證插座是否提供了正確的電量。 如果您在美國工作，則應該期望從辦公室或家庭的電源插座接收115 VAC至120 VAC（交流電壓）的電壓。 可以使用簡單的三叉測試儀，電壓表或萬用表進行驗證。 程序上，切勿將電線從電線中拉出，因為這會導致電纜損壞和磨損。 相反，您應該插入插頭並通過電源線末端的插頭拔出電纜。 切勿使用磨損或損壞的電源線，這一點很重要。 \n In addition to keeping themselves safe, technicians need to keep computers safe from electrical damage. It is common to use a surge protector to protect computers from power spikes or surges. A power strip is not the same thing as a surge protector. Surge protectors are rated in joules (J), a unit of energy. The rating indicates the number of joules the surge protector can absorb before failure. A higher rating indicates greater protection for the computer. Also, you must not overload the surge protectors, and must never daisy-chain them, or plug one surge protector into another: this causes higher amperage draws that can lead to fires. \n 除了保護自己的安全外，技術人員還需要保護計算機免受電氣損壞。 通常使用電湧保護器來保護計算機免受電源尖峰或電湧的影響。 配電盤與電湧保護器不是一回事。 電湧保護器的額定功率單位為焦耳（J）。 額定值表示電湧保護器在故障之前可以吸收的焦耳數。 額定值越高，表示對計算機的保護越高。 另外，您一定不能使電湧保護器過載，也不能以菊花鏈的方式將其電湧，或將一個電湧保護器插入另一個電湧保護器：這會導致電流消耗增加，從而引發火災。 \n Overloaded electrical outlet.

A UPS should never be used for laser printers, as it draws too much power through the UPS and can cause damage to the printer. \n 如果需要為工作站持續供電，則可以使用不間斷電源（UPS）。 切勿將UPS用於激光打印機，因為它會通過UPS消耗過多功率，並可能損壞打印機。 \n When working with a computer, the largest amount of voltage you will find is located inside the computer’s power supply unit (PSU). You should \xa0 never \xa0 disassemble a PSU; when it is broken, simply replace the entire unit. Power supply units are relatively inexpensive, so it is a best practice to simply replace them. Some technicians wonder why they should not disassemble or open the PSU and try to fix it, but the reason is simple — it is \xa0 very \xa0 dangerous. A PSU has numerous electrical components that allow it to convert the high-voltage 115-120 VAC (or 230-240 VAC) power into the 12 VDC (volts direct current) that is usable by the computer. Some of these components are capacitors, which cause the power supply to retain lots of voltage (up to 10,000 volts or more) even after the computer is turned off and even after the computer and PSU are unplugged. Therefore, if you want to see the inside of a PSU, search for it on the Internet and look at a picture. It is much safer. \n 使用計算機時，您會發現最大的電壓位於計算機的電源設備（PSU）內部。 您切勿拆卸電源設備； 損壞時，只需更換整個單元。 電源設備相對便宜，因此最佳實踐是簡單地更換它們。 一些技術人員想知道為什麼不應該拆卸或打開PSU並嘗試對其進行修復，但是原因很簡單-這非常危險。 PSU具有許多電氣組件，可將115-120 VAC（或230-240 VAC）高壓電源轉換為計算機可使用的12 VDC（直流電壓）。 這些組件中的一些是電容器，即使在關閉計算機後以及拔下計算機和PSU的電源後，電源也會保持大量電壓（最高10,000伏或更高）。 因此，如果要查看PSU的內部，請在Internet上搜索它並查看圖片。 這更安全。 \n \n Computer PSU. Photo used under CC-BY-NC license from \xa0 cand3la . \n Power Supplies \n Technicians should use surge protectors or surge suppressors to protect computers from power spikes and surges. These devices are specifically designed to absorb overvoltage conditions that would damage computers, printers, and monitors. While these devices will protect the computer from damage resulting from an overvoltage condition, they do not protect it from an undervoltage condition. Undervoltage is a condition that occurs when insufficient voltage is provided by the outlet to the computer. In situations where it is essential that the computer not lose power, technicians must install an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to provide emergency power when a power failure (blackout) occurs or an undervoltage condition (brownout) occurs. The UPS runs the computer from its internal battery continuously and recharges the UPS’s battery while power is available. Once power is lost, the UPS continues to power the computer for up to 15 minutes (purportedly). This provides the user enough time to save work and safely power down the workstation. Another device that helps in undervoltage conditions is the standby power supply (SPS), which runs the computer directly from the wall outlet (AC power), but switches to the battery in less than a millisecond when a power outage occurs. An SPS device does not provide constant power, like a UPS device. For this reason, most technicians prefer UPS devices over SPS devices, so UPS devices are much more common in the marketplace. \n 技術人員應使用電湧保護器或電湧抑制器來保護計算機免受電湧和電湧的影響。這些設備經過專門設計，可以吸收可能損壞計算機，打印機和顯示器的過電壓情況。雖然這些設備可以保護計算機免受過壓狀態造成的損壞，但它們不能保護計算機免受欠壓狀態的影響。當計算機的插座提供的電壓不足時，就會發生欠壓情況。在必須確保計算機不掉電的情況下，技術人員必須安裝不間斷電源（UPS），以在發生電源故障（停電）或發生欠壓情況（斷電）時提供應急電源。 UPS會使用其內部電池連續運行計算機，並在有電時為UPS的電池充電。一旦斷電，UPS將繼續為計算機供電長達15分鐘（據稱）。這為用戶提供了足夠的時間來節省工作並安全地關閉工作站電源。備用電源（SPS）是在欠壓情況下提供幫助的另一種設備，該備用電源直接從壁裝電源插座（交流電源）運行計算機，但在斷電時不到一毫秒即可切換到電池。 SPS設備不像UPS設備那樣提供恆定功率。因此，與SPS設備相比，大多數技術人員更喜歡UPS設備，因此UPS設備在市場上更為普遍。 \n \n Uninterruptible power supply. Photo used under CC-BY license from \xa0 Wonderlane . \n \n Uninterruptible power supplies are rated in various ways, including their runtimes, network support capabilities, automatic shutdown capabilities, and surge suppression. The runtime dictates the amount of time a computer will keep running on power from the UPS’s battery once source power is removed. Usually, you want to use a UPS with at least 15 minutes of runtime support. The bigger the battery, the longer the runtime. The runtime is calculated based on volt-amps, which is discussed in more detail in a later section. UPS devices can also have software that allows them to be connected to the network. Therefore, when the UPS notices a drop in power, it can send out a message to the users that the network is being shut down because of power loss. Some UPS devices support automatic shutdown of the connected computer or server, so that once a switch to battery power occurs, the UPS sends a shutdown signal to the connected machine. Finally, most UPS devices also provide surge suppression capabilities, rated in joules. \n 不間斷電源的額定方式有多種，包括其運行時間，網絡支持功能，自動關機功能和電湧抑制。運行時間決定了斷開電源後計算機將繼續使用UPS電池供電的時間。通常，您要使用具有至少15分鐘運行時間支持的UPS。電池越大，運行時間越長。運行時間是基於伏安計算的，這將在後面的部分中詳細討論。 UPS設備還可以具有允許其連接到網絡的軟件。因此，當UPS注意到電源中斷時，它可以向用戶發送一條消息，通知您由於斷電而導致網絡正在關閉。某些UPS設備支持所連接的計算機或服務器的自動關機，因此一旦切換到電池電源，UPS就會向所連接的計算機發送關機信號。最後，大多數UPS設備還提供以焦耳為單位的電湧抑制功能。 \n The last type of device technicians can use is called a power conditioner or line conditioner. These devices do not have any battery backup capability, but can rectify the power from a dirty power condition (where power fluctuates greatly) to a steady 115-120 VAC power condition. These devices can raise undervoltage conditions to normal levels, as well as cut overvoltage conditions back down to standard levels. This is very important if your systems are going to run from a backup generator, or if you are operating in an area with unstable power (such as in some developing countries). \n \n \n \n 技術人員可以使用的最後一種設備稱為功率調節器或線路調節器。 這些設備沒有任何備用電池功能，但是可以將電源從骯髒的電源狀況（電源波動很大）整流為穩定的115-120 VAC電源狀況。 這些器件可將欠壓條件提高到正常水平，並將過壓條件降低迴標準水平。 如果您的系統要使用備用發電機運行，或者您在電力不穩定的區域（例如在某些發展中國家）運行，則這非常重要。 \n \n Power Variation \n \n It is important to understand the technical terms for the various undervoltage and overvoltage conditions that could exist, such as power surge, dirty power, sag, brownout, and blackout, as well as the device that provides protection to the computers and computer system equipment when these conditions occur. A power surge occurs when a short increase in AC voltage happens, such as from 120 VAC to 130 VAC. To protect computers from this condition, you would use a surge suppressor. Dirty power occurs when AC voltage continuously fluctuates, for example between 113 VAC and 130 VAC. To correct this condition, an in-line UPS or line conditioner should be used. A sag occurs when an unexpected short decrease in voltage occurs. This can be corrected with either a line conditioner or a UPS. A brownout is a more significant, larger voltage drop than a sag, and could result in the voltage being cut in half (such as 120 VAC dropping to 60 VAC). This is too much for a line conditioner to handle, so a UPS would be required. Finally, if there is a complete loss of power, this is called a blackout. Only a UPS can solve this problem, but only for a short duration (purportedly about 15 minutes). If operations must continue after this, you would need to switch to a backup generator to provide the power required. \n \n 重要的是要理解可能存在的各種欠壓和過壓條件的技術術語，例如電湧，臟電源，跌落，掉電和停電，以及在以下情況下為計算機和計算機系統設備提供保護的設備：這些情況發生。當交流電壓發生短暫升高（例如從120 VAC到130 VAC）時，就會發生電湧。為了保護計算機免受這種情況的影響，應使用電湧抑制器。當交流電壓持續波動（例如在113 VAC和130 VAC之間）時，會產生臟電。要糾正這種情況，應使用串聯式UPS或線路調節器。當電壓出現意外的短時下降時，就會發生下垂。可以使用電源調節器或UPS進行糾正。掉電比下垂更為嚴重，且電壓降更大，並且可能導致電壓降低一半（例如120 VAC降至60 VAC）。對於線路調節器來說，這太多了，因此需要UPS。最後，如果完全斷電，則稱為停電。只有UPS可以解決此問題，但只能持續很短的時間（據說大約15分鐘）。如果此後必須繼續操作，則需要切換到備用發電機以提供所需的電源。 \n \n Protecting People and Property\xa0保護人身和財產 \n \n Electricity can be a common cause of fire, especially if the electrical circuits are overloaded. If a computer or outlet catches on fire, you should use a class C extinguisher, which is a carbon dioxide (CO 2 )-based extinguisher. You should not attempt to extinguish an electrical fire with water, because water conducts electricity. If the fire is small, you may use a portable extinguisher to put the fire out immediately, but you should never put yourself in harm’s way. If the fire begins to get out of control, everyone should move to a safe area and call 911 for help immediately. Some server rooms have built-in fire suppression systems that release CO 2 \xa0 or halon when a fire alarm occurs. Halon is a toxic compressed gas, in liquid form, that chemically disrupts a combustion reaction. A CO 2 \xa0 system is designed to flood the room with carbon dioxide in order to remove all oxygen from the room, thereby killing the fire. People who are working in a server room and hear the fire alarm sounding must immediately vacate the area and get to a safe location. This is a life-threatening situation, both because of the fire and because of the potentially lethal nature of the fire-suppression systems. \n 電力可能是引起火災的常見原因，尤其是在電路過載的情況下。如果計算機或插座著火，則應使用C類滅火器，它是一種基於二氧化碳（CO2）的滅火器。您不應嘗試用水滅火，因為水可以導電。如果火很小，則可以使用便攜式滅火器將火立即撲滅，但絕對不要傷害自己。如果火勢開始失控，所有人應移至安全區域並立即撥打911尋求幫助。一些服務器機房具有內置的滅火系統，當發生火災警報時，這些系統會釋放CO2或哈龍。哈龍是有毒的壓縮氣體，呈液態，化學上會破壞燃燒反應。 CO2系統設計用於向房間充斥二氧化碳，以清除房間中的所有氧氣，從而撲滅大火。在服務器機房工作並聽到火警警報的人員必須立即離開該區域並到達安全位置。由於起火以及滅火系統的潛在致命特性，這是威脅生命的情況。 \n \n Operational Procedures: Electrostatic Discharge\xa0操作步驟：靜電放電 \n \n Another major safety hazard for computer systems and components is electrostatic discharge (ESD). ESD damage is caused by the discharge of static electricity that has been built up by the human body in the course of everyday events, such as walking, standing and sitting at our desks, and other activities. In drier (less humid) environments, static electricity builds up more quickly and becomes more of an issue. This is especially true during winter months. While static electricity cannot directly harm humans very much, it can be deadly to computer components. A person builds static electricity that can reach 20,000 to 25,000 volts, but is of a low amperage (making it safe for humans). When you touch something of lower electrical potential, such as the metal case of the computer or the circuit board of an expansion card, the static electricity in your body is discharged into that component, causing damage. If you touch a circuit board without taking ESD precautions, ESD may occur and cause permanent failure or an intermittent failure of the component. \n 計算機系統和組件的另一個主要安全隱患是靜電放電（ESD）。 ESD損壞是由人體在日常活動過程中（例如走路，站立和坐在辦公桌旁以及其他活動中）積聚的靜電釋放引起的。在乾燥（濕度較低）的環境中，靜電積聚更快，成為一個更大的問題。在冬季尤其如此。儘管靜電不會直接對人類造成很大的傷害，但它可能對計算機組件造成致命的傷害。一個人積聚的靜電可以達到20,000到25,000伏，但電流強度很低（對人類安全）。當您觸摸電勢較低的物體（例如計算機的金屬外殼或擴充卡的電路板）時，體內的靜電會釋放到該組件中，從而造成損壞。如果在未採取ESD預防措施的情況下觸摸電路板，則可能會發生ESD，並導致組件永久性故障或間歇性故障。 \n You can protect computer equipment from ESD fairly easily. First, you should use an antistatic wrist strap, also known as an ESD strap. \n 您可以相當容易地保護計算機設備免受ESD的影響。 首先，應使用防靜電腕帶，也稱為ESD腕帶。 \n \n ESD strap. Photo used under CC-BY-ND license from \xa0 Carl Bereley . \n These devices are very inexpensive and are the best method of protecting equipment against ESD. To be effective, one end of the strap must be grounded (by clipping it to something such as to the bare metal of the computer case), and the other end is placed around your wrist like a bracelet. This continually causes a discharge from the body to the computer case, thereby protecting the internal computer components. Because of the high voltage present inside a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor, you should not wear an ESD wrist strap when working inside a CRT monitor. \n 這些設備非常便宜，是保護設備免受ESD影響的最佳方法。 為使之有效，必須將腕帶的一端接地（通過將其修剪到諸如計算機機殼裸露的東西上），另一端像手鐲一樣放在手腕上。 這不斷導致從身體向計算機機殼的放電，從而保護了計算機內部組件。 由於陰極射線管（CRT）監視器內部存在高壓，因此在CRT監視器內部進行操作時，請勿佩戴ESD腕帶。 \n If you do not have an ESD strap, you can employ the second precautionary method, called grounding against the chassis. In this method, you touch any unpainted metal part of the computer case to discharge the static electricity from your body before touching the sensitive components (such as expansion cards). This method is quite good, but you must remember to ground yourself against the case \xa0 every \xa0 time before touching a component. The last precautionary method is to use anti-static bags. This procedure is useful during transport of various components. Basically, you place the components and cards inside the anti-static bag to protect them from ESD while you are carrying them from one location to another. \n 如果沒有ESD綁帶，則可以採用第二種預防方法，即與機箱接地。 通過這種方法，在觸摸敏感組件（例如擴展卡）之前，請觸摸計算機機箱上任何未上漆的金屬部分，以釋放身上的靜電。 這種方法相當不錯，但是每次觸摸組件之前，您都必須記住要使自己始終與外殼接觸。 最後一種預防方法是使用防靜電袋。 此過程在運輸各種組件時很有用。 基本上，將組件和卡從一個位置搬運到另一位置時，請將其放置在防靜電袋中，以防靜電。 \n \n Anti-static bag. Photo used under CC-BY license from \xa0 Joe Hall . \n \n To prevent ESD we must ensure we handle components properly. Never touch the face of the cards where the components and wiring are located; only handle cards by the edges. Additionally, always use proper ESD straps or grounding techniques before handling the cards. You also should remove jewelry and avoid loose clothes, since they may get caught in the computer or inadvertently cause a static charge to be transferred into a component. Another great technique is the use of an anti-static mat or workbench. Many server rooms and IT shops have these mats installed, and they provide a good method of keeping yourself grounded while working. You can also raise the humidity of the room to minimize the chances of static build-up. Most computer server rooms keep humidity between 40 and 50 percent to minimize electrostatic build-up, but often you will not have control over the humidity as a technician. You also want to avoid carpeted areas when possible, as walking across carpet creates a faster buildup of static electricity in the body. Finally, never use electrical or magnetic tools on the workstation, as the electrical motors from drills, impact wrenches, and vacuums create static electricity that can be discharged into fragile components. \n 為了防止ESD，我們必須確保正確處理組件。切勿觸摸組件和配線所在的卡的表面；只能處理邊緣的卡。此外，在處理插卡之前，請始終使用正確的ESD腕帶或接地技術。您還應卸下珠寶首飾並避免穿寬鬆的衣服，因為它們可能會卡在計算機中或無意間導致靜電荷轉移到組件中。另一個很棒的技術是使用防靜電墊或工作台。許多服務器機房和IT商店都安裝了這些墊子，它們是在工作時保持接地的一種好方法。您還可以提高房間的濕度，以最大程度減少靜電積聚的機會。大多數計算機服務器機房將濕度保持在40％到50％之間，以最大程度地減少靜電積聚，但是作為技術人員，您通常無法控制濕度。您還希望盡可能避免舖有地毯的區域，因為在地毯上行走會在體內更快地積聚靜電。最後，切勿在工作站上使用電動工具或電磁工具，因為鑽頭，衝擊扳手和真空吸塵器產生的電動機會產生靜電，這些靜電會排放到易碎的部件中。 \n \n Operational Procedures: Environmental Controls\xa0操作程序：環境控制 \n So, what is the best range of environmental controls to protect our workstations and provide our computers with the best operating environment? For temperature, we seek a range of 68-76 degrees Fahrenheit, and we attempt to keep the humidity between 20 and 60 percent. If the humidity is higher, it prevents electrostatic buildup. If the humidity is too high, though, condensation and water vapor can occur. It is a fragile balance, but the best rule of thumb is that if humans are comfortable, the environment is probably within the specifications. Also, we need to ensure proper ventilation for both people and computers. We want to minimize the dust in the environment and ensure adequate cooling to remove the heat created by the workstations. \n 那麼，保護我們的工作站並為我們的計算機提供最佳操作環境的最佳環境控制範圍是什麼？ 對於溫度，我們尋求的溫度範圍為華氏68-76度，並且嘗試將濕度保持在20％到60％之間。 如果濕度較高，則可防止靜電積聚。 但是，如果濕度太高，則會發生冷凝和水蒸氣。 這是一個脆弱的平衡，但是最好的經驗法則是，如果人類感到舒適，則環境可能在規格範圍內。 此外，我們需要確保人和計算機的通風良好。 我們希望最大程度地減少環境中的灰塵，並確保充分冷卻以消除工作站產生的熱量。 \n Additionally, we need to consider the chemicals that we often encounter in our daily jobs. Each product that uses chemicals must have a material safety data sheet (MSDS) with it. This sheet includes the proper treatment if a person comes into contact with the substance, how to deal with chemical spills, how to properly dispose of the chemicals, and proper storage of the substance. MSDS are required for \xa0 all \xa0 products with chemicals, including things like window cleaning solution as well as more complex compounds like the thermal paste that we use in workstations. \n 此外，我們需要考慮日常工作中經常遇到的化學物質。 每個使用化學藥品的產品都必須隨附材料安全數據表（MSDS）。 該表包括人接觸該物質時的適當處理，如何處理化學溢出物，如何正確處置化學物質以及正確存儲該物質。 所有含化學物質的產品都需要MSDS，包括窗戶清潔液以及更複雜的化合物（例如我們在工作站中使用的導熱膏）。 \n Operational Procedures: Physical Safety\xa0操作步驟：人身安全 \n Since we have considered the electrical dangers a technician might face, we must also consider the physical dangers. As information technology technicians, we often are involved in the “rollout” and replacement of existing systems, and in moving equipment from one office area to another. In this portion of our jobs, we often have to move hundreds of computers. Remember, the number one cause of injury for computer technicians is lifting items that are too heavy for us. A couple of rules of thumb to prevent injury: Do not lift anything over 25 percent of your own weight without assistance. Second, remember to always lift with your legs, not your back. If you follow these two simple rules, you can avoid the most common injuries in the workplace. \n 由於我們已經考慮了技術人員可能面臨的電氣危險，因此我們還必須考慮物理危險。 作為信息技術人員，我們經常參與“部署”和替換現有系統，以及將設備從一個辦公區域轉移到另一個辦公區域。 在這部分工作中，我們經常不得不移動數百台計算機。 請記住，計算機技術人員受傷的首要原因是提起對我們來說太重的物品。 防止受傷的一些經驗法則：不要在沒有幫助的情況下舉起超過自身體重25％的東西。 其次，請記住始終抬起雙腿，而不是背部。 如果遵循這兩個簡單規則，則可以避免在工作場所中最常見的傷害。 \n Another area of concern is our impatience. Often when we go to work on a computer, we first turn off the machine and then open it up. Many of us forget that the computer may have been on and running for the past several days or weeks, building up an enormous amount of heat that can cause burns. It is a good idea to wait at least 15 minutes before touching items at the workstation, such as a laser printer’s fuser, the central processing unit (CPU) of the computer, or the power supply of the computer. These areas tend to generate the most heat and need time to dissipate the heat prior to maintenance. \n 另一個值得關注的領域是我們的耐心。 通常，當我們在計算機上工作時，首先關閉機器，然後再打開它。 我們中的許多人都忘記了計算機可能已經在過去的幾天或幾週內開機並運行，從而積聚了大量的熱量，可能引起灼傷。 最好等待至少15分鐘，然後再觸摸工作站上的物品，例如激光打印機的定影器，計算機的中央處理器（CPU）或計算機的電源。 這些區域會產生最多的熱量，並且在維護之前需要時間消散熱量。 \n Finally, we must be wary of how we route cables, and must practice proper cable management. Do not run cables in the walkways or through places where employees may trip over them. If a worker trips on the cord, not only will the worker get hurt, but the workstation itself could be pulled off the desk and damaged. Place the computer and cables in a place where adequate air flow can occur; otherwise, the computer may overheat and have issues functioning. Finally, always remember to check local regulations when installing new network cables. Some areas require certain licenses or certifications, such as an electrician’s license, to run network cables. Also, you will need to install \xa0 plenum-rated cables \xa0 if you are running them in areas such as the ceiling, where ventilation systems are found. \n 最後，我們必須警惕如何佈設電纜，並且必須進行適當的電纜管理。 請勿在走道或員工可能絆倒的地方穿過電纜。 如果工人用電線絆倒，不僅會受傷，而且工作站本身可能會從桌子上拉下來並損壞。 將計算機和電纜放置在可產生足夠空氣流通的地方； 否則，計算機可能會過熱並出現問題。 最後，在安裝新的網絡電纜時，切記要檢查當地法規。 有些地區需要某些許可證或證明（例如電工許可證）才能運行網絡電纜。 另外，如果要在通風等有天花板的區域（如天花板）上鋪設增壓電纜，則需要安裝增壓電纜。 \n \n Proper cable management. Photo used under CC-BY-NC license from \xa0 Adrian Black . \n So, why is cable management so important? Well, imagine your boss just told you that her workstation lost its connection to the network. You run down to the server room to see if you can troubleshoot her connection. You look first to check if her cable is plugged in, but you find the mess of cables below. How do you determine which is your boss’ connection? This mess causes issues with ventilation, cooling, and more importantly issues when trying to troubleshoot. Always run the cabling with proper cable management techniques and label the cables to assist you in the future during troubleshooting. \n 那麼，為什麼電纜管理如此重要？ 好吧，想像一下您的老闆剛剛告訴您她的工作站失去了與網絡的連接。 您跑到服務器機房查看是否可以解決她的連接故障。 您首先要檢查她的電纜是否已插入，但在下面發現電纜亂七八糟。 您如何確定老闆的聯繫方式？ 這種混亂會導致通風，冷卻問題，更重要的是，嘗試進行故障排除時會出現問題。 始終使用適當的電纜管理技術來佈線，並標記電纜，以在將來進行故障排除時為您提供幫助。 \n \n Unsafe cables.

Photo used under CC-BY-NC-ND license from \xa0 Jisc . \n \n Operational Procedures: CRT Disposal\xa0操作程序：CRT處置 \n Many older monitors you may find in the field are CRT monitors. These older monitors look like old televisions. These monitors tend to be very heavy, with 30” or larger models weighing nearly a hundred pounds. It is important to remember your lifting rules before moving these monitors. Most people are upgrading these old monitors to LCD or LED models, since they offer better picture quality and are much lighter. Many locations have special disposal rules for these devices. Many localities have a requirement to recycle monitors at a central waste facility. Finally, these monitors use capacitors to perform their functions. You must be careful not to open these monitors, as they can have 10,000-20,000 volts of potential voltage, even when they have been unplugged for long periods of time. \n 您可能在現場發現的許多較舊的顯示器都是CRT顯示器。 這些較舊的監視器看起來像舊電視。 這些監視器往往非常重，具有30英寸或更大的型號，重近一百磅。 在移動這些顯示器之前，請記住您的舉升規則，這一點很重要。 大多數人都將這些舊顯示器升級為LCD或LED型號，因為它們提供了更好的圖像質量並且更輕。 許多位置對於這些設備都有特殊的處置規則。 許多地方都要求在中央廢物處理設施回收監測器。 最後，這些監視器使用電容器來執行其功能。 您必須小心不要打開這些顯示器，因為它們可能具有10,000-20,000伏的潛在電壓，即使長時間拔下電源也是如此。 \n 影片連結 \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH2\xa0Procedures and Safety.html'}, {'title': 'PCH3', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH3.html'}, {'title': 'Kaggle', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Kaggle.html'}, {'title': 'cp2020', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'cp2020.html'}, {'title': '問題排除', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '問題排除.html'}, {'title': '1 heading問題', 'text': '已知heading無法使用標點符號作為標題 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '1 heading問題.html'}, {'title': '2 提醒', 'text': '根據嘗試遠端更新資料速度貌似要過好幾分鐘才會更新 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '2 提醒.html'}, {'title': '3 user內容的方式', 'text': '.gitconfig若要新增username跟usergmail還是以指令輸入較好，貌似就算格式符合手動輸入依然跟指令輸入有些不同(PS即便我自己是手動添加但其他同學卻出現讀不出來的情況)，會出現無法使用的name和gmail並叫我以指令添加，目前無法得知手動輸入和指令輸入的差別或自行輸入錯誤，但用指令輸入並無其他問題算是排除 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '3 user內容的方式.html'}, {'title': '4 github page not updating', 'text': '再上傳3.問題時由於我將內文設定成heading並且此內容裡正好包含標點符號，所以合理猜測由於跟1.問題符合導致東西在PUSH上去時可能無法讀取或錯誤進而導致靜態網頁內容更改但遠端網站的setting無法成功(若要成功必須有 GitHub Pages successfully built your site.跟 GitHub Pages successfully built your site.就是綠勾勾的出現)，所以即便倉儲的東西及標籤都是最新的但網站setting並不符合或承認此內容資料，將內文的heading的設定消除掉後重新PUSH上去就沒問題，起初以為是設定有動到所以上網找資料查詢但發現都是updataing網站更新數據問題，但我並未出現404錯誤所以我就往是否為我PUSH上去的內容有不符合或錯誤來實驗並最後得出此答案，問題解除 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '4 github page not updating.html'}, {'title': '5 網站編輯器無法開啟', 'text': '因為不明原因，導致編輯器無法啟動變成只打開原始代碼，先將目錄換到cmsimde用git pull將最新版代替舊版，將新的cmsimde代替原本的來解決 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '5 網站編輯器無法開啟.html'}, {'title': '6', 'text': '\n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '6.html'}, {'title': '教學歷程', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '教學歷程.html'}, {'title': 'W1至W8', 'text': '1.網路的一些性質及介紹等(proxy,ipv6,ipv4等) 2.利用kaggle進行網路上的程式編寫練習 3.Github,gitter,Heroku,等之間的使用方法及目的: 基本來說利用USB或者電腦本身進行寫程式(近端)，不只讓他保存並將其推到網路上(遠端)以實現多重保障並也能讓其他人觀看自己的作品，方便之後若有需要時不會發生資料遺漏或者資料不小心遺失也能搶救。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W1至W8.html'}, {'title': 'W8 test', 'text': '\n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W8 test.html'}, {'title': 'W9', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W9.html'}]};
